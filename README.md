Book Recommendation Engine using KNN  Machine Learning with Python
# Book Recommendation Engine using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project implements a book recommendation system based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Python. It recommends similar books to a given book title by analyzing user ratings and finding books with similar rating patterns.

## Overview

The recommendation engine uses collaborative filtering with the KNN algorithm and cosine similarity metric. It identifies books with similar user rating patterns and suggests them as recommendations.

---

## Dataset

The project uses the [Book-Crossings Dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/), which contains user ratings for books along with metadata (title, author, publisher, etc).

- `BX-Books.csv` — book metadata
- `BX-Book-Ratings.csv` — user ratings
